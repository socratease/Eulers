Hello Folks.

I am just picking up the skill as a hobby, and because I am young and I've already realized it can never hurt to know some coding. I am starting with Pyhton and Java because I think it'd be fun to develop an Android App, and it seems like the basics of any Python are fairly straightforward and transferrable.
