# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
#we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
#The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# step one: if % number/5 =0, add to list.
# step two: do this for all numbers in range
# step three: skip if number is already in list, skip it
