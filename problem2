# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
#By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values 
#do not exceed four million,
#find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#list of fibonacci numbers-add i, plus max number in list, add that to list.
#limit loop to under 4 million
# if evenly divisible by two, addd to separate list
#sum that list
